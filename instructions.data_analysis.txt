Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("DoctorVisits.csv")
df.head(15)

Display complete information about the columns of the dataset such as Column name, Count, Data type and overoll memory usage
df.info()

Find out the total no.of people based on their count of illness
df["illness"].value_counts()
df["gender"].value_counts()

Visualize and analyse the maximum, minimum and medium income
y=list(df.income)
plt.boxplot(y)
plt.show()

Findout the no.of days of reduced activity of male and female separately due to illness
df.groupby(['gender','reduced']).mean()

Visualize is there is any missing values in the dataset based on a heat map
#missing values
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(),cbar=False,cmap='viridis')

Findout the correlation between variables in the given dataset correlation between different variables
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(),cbar=True,annot=True,cmap='Blues')

Analyse how the income of a patient affects the no.of visits to the hospital
#relation between income and visits
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
plt.scatter(x='income',y='visits',data=df)
plt.xlabel('income')

Count and visualize the number of males and females affected by illness
sns.histplot(df.gender,bins=2)

Visualize the percentage of people getting health Insurance due to low income, due to old age and also the percentage of people having private health

Plot a horizontal bar chart to analyse the reduced days of activity due to illness based on Gender
db=df.groupby('gender')['reduced'].sum().to_frame().reset_index()
#creating the bar chart
plt.barh(db['gender'],db['reduced'],color = ['cornflowerblue','lightseagreen'])
#Adding the aesthetics
